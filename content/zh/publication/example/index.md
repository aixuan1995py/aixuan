abstract: A theoretical and experimental study gives insights into the nature of
  the metal–boron electronic interaction in boron-bearing intermetallics and its
  effects on surface hydrogen adsorption and hydrogen-evolving catalytic
  activity. Strong hybridization between the d orbitals of transition metal (TM)
  and the sp orbitals of boron exists in a family of fifteen TM–boron
  intermatallics (TM:B=1:1), and hydrogen atoms adsorb more weakly to the
  metal-terminated intermetallic surfaces than to the corresponding pure metal
  surfaces. This modulation of electronic structure makes several intermetallics
  (e.g., PdB, RuB, ReB) prospective, efficient hydrogen-evolving materials with
  catalytic activity close to Pt. A general reaction pathway towards the
  synthesis of such TMB intermetallics is provided; a class of seven phase-pure
  TMB intermetallics, containing V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, and Ru, are thus
  synthesized. RuB is a high-performing, non-platinum electrocatalyst for the
  hydrogen evolution reaction.
