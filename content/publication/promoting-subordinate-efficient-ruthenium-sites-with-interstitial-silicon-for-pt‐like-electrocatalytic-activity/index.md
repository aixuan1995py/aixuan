abstract: The fundamental understanding and rational manipulation of catalytic
  site preference at extended solid surfaces is crucial in the search for
  advanced catalysts. Herein we find that the Ru top sites at metallic ruthenium
  surface have efficient Pt-like activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction
  (HER), but they are subordinate to their adjacent, less active Ru3-hollow
  sites due to the stronger hydrogen-binding ability of the latter. We also
  present an interstitial incorporation strategy for the promotion of the Ru top
  sites from subordinate to dominant character, while maintaining Pt-like
  catalytic activity. Our combined theoretical and experimental studies further
  identify intermetallic RuSi as a highly active, non-Pt material for catalyzing
  the HER, because of its suitable electronic structure governed by a good
  balance of ligand and strain effects.
