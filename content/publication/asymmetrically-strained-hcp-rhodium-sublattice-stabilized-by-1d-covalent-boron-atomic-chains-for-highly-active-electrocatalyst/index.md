abstract: Intermetallic rhodium boride (RhB) comprising an asymmetrically
  strained hcp Rh sublattice is synthesized. The covalent interaction of
  interstitial boron atoms is found to be the main contributor to the generation
  of asymmetric strains and the stabilization of the hcp Rh sublattice. In
  addition, RhB is identified as a hydrogen-evolving eletrocatalyst with Pt-like
  activity, because the Rh(d)–B(s,p) orbital hybridization induces an optimized
  electronic structure.
