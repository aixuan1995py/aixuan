abstract: A family of twelve monometallic diborides, containing transition
  metals from group IVB elements to group VIII elements, and Ni–W bimetallic
  diborides are synthesized via a molten salt-assisted method. Their trend in
  activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction is studied, with Ni–W bimetallic
  diborides acting as the most efficient, nonprecious electrocatalysts.
