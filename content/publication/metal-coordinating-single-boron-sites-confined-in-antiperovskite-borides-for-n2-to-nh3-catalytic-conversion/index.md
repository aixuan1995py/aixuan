abstract: The concept of single-atom catalysts (SACs) takes our understanding of
  active sites of heterogeneous catalysts to greater heights. While the
  knowledge about the SACs containing isolated metal centers has rapidly
  enriched over the last decade, a few examples of the SACs that feature
  single-nonmetal centers are studied, and their application potentials are also
  poorly explored. Herein, we report a family of 358 model surfaces featuring
  metal-coordinated single-boron sites for investigating the effects of
  boron-centered local environment on N2-to-NH3 catalytic conversion. We
  demonstrate these model surfaces with (001) surfaces of antiperovskite borides
  (M3M′B, M, and M′ represent different metal atoms), where the surface-isolated
  boron atoms are spacially separated by M atoms, but they do not directly bond
  to M′ atoms. The surface-isolated boron atoms are found to be necessary for
  the adsorption and activation of dinitrogen, and the types of M atoms
  determine dinitrogen adsorption configurations. When M atoms are the late
  transition metals (e.g., Ni), dinitrogen prefers to adsorb on the top-site of
  the surface B atom with an end-on configuration; when M atoms are
  alkaline-earth metals, early transition metals and lanthanide elements (e.g.,
  Sr, Zr, and La) and dinitrogen bonds to M–B–M three-center site with a side-on
  configuration. Additionally, during the catalytic conversion of dinitrogen to
  ammonia, the M atoms cooperate with the isolated boron atom to costabilize
  NxHy intermediates (x = 1, 2; y = 0–4), and the M′ atoms finely regulate the
  electronic structure of B–M ensembles and thereby tune the adsorption property
  and catalytic activity. Furthermore, the adsorption free energy of *N is found
  to be applied as a descriptor of the limiting potential of dinitrogen
  reduction reaction, and its value is correlated with orbital hybridization
  between M and B atoms apart from the inherent electronic properties of M and B
  atoms. Finally, we predict Rh3GeB, Rh3SbB, and Ni3LiB to be promising ammonia
  synthesis catalysts with high activity that exceed that of the stepped
  Ru(0001) surface, a prominent benchmarking surface for ammonia synthesis.
